## Stacks

| Stack | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Traefik | `stacks/proxy/traefik` | Reverse proxy with automatic TLS via Let's Encrypt |
| Grafana + Prometheus | `stacks/monitoring/grafana-prometheus` | Metrics collection and visualization |

## Quick Start

```bash
# clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/atsauban/homelab-stack.git && cd homelab-stack
bash scripts/setup.sh

# traefik needs DOMAIN, ACME_EMAIL, and CF_DNS_API_TOKEN before anything works
# generate dashboard password: echo $(htpasswd -nB admin) | sed -e 's/\$/\$\$/g'
nano stacks/proxy/traefik/.env

# start traefik first, other stacks depend on its network
cd stacks/proxy/traefik && docker compose up -d
```

Other stacks can be started independently after Traefik is up. See [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) for the full walkthrough.

## Prerequisites

Open a PR. Keep changes focused — one stack or fix per PR. If you're adding a new stack, follow the existing structure: pinned images, health checks, resource limits, `.env` for secrets.
